## Summary

PhD candidate developing statistical methods to study how emotion perceived in music
relates to its historic context and listeners’ musical experiences.

Developing software applications to make findings from quantitative music analyses
accessible to listeners.

Master’s thesis examined musical and psychological data, using data science methods
to detect musical patterns in music from different periods.

### Research interests

Data science, music analysis, experimental psychology, tone synthesis, machine learning, music information retrieval.
